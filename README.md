# py-athan
Python application that plays all 5 athans timely, and reminds of Sunrise time. 


# SETUP

- Clone the repo
- Run the *requirements.sh* file to install the required python libs
- Once done, run the *run.sh* file to start the application.

Notes:
- By default, the app uses latitude and longitude of Toronto. You should adjust it accordingly by getting the information from google maps. 
- Time information is provided by https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api#GetCalendar. Thanks to the developers! 
- Read the link above to adjust the parameters that may help you go get your prayer times based on schools and methods. However, most of the things have already been tuned up! 
- The app takes an update of prayer times once when you start it and at 12:00:00am every night.
- Keep the app running and it does not take much memory. 
- Feel free to let me know your thoughts.
